            <h2>Software Engineer Extraordinaire</h2>
            <p>"I approach programming through the lens of a mathematician. Every project is a series of equations that can 
            be applied to solve the problem both efficiently and precisely.
            I do not shy away from big challenges and have the determination to find solutions, no matter how daunting the task."</p>

        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p class="aboutMe"> I studied math in college, took a break after, and "through-hiked" the 
        Pacific Crest Trail (a backpacking trail that goes from Mexico to Canada... 2,650 miles!).
        After that, I went on to be an actuary for three years in LA, working in the Catastrophe Modeling department. 
        While I was exploring and discovering new foods in the mecca of cuisine, I was also able to explore and 
        discover what I actually liked to do. Part of my job was to take big data sets and use
        SQL/SAS to merge, manipulate and apply modifications to that data. I found that I lost track of time
        challenging myself to come up with the most efficienct solutions to perform 
        my work. After realizing I was probably in the wrong field, I signed up for General Assembly's 
        Software Engineering Immersive Program, which gave me the tools to now pursue a meangingful career. 
        I hope to use my analytical mind in the work I create, and cultivate code that reflects my way of thinking.

            <a href="https://amymhinds.github.io/Project-1---Battleship/"><img  class="bpic" src = "https://i.imgur.com/r0M2erh.jpg"></a>
            <p class = "bdescr">This was the very first project I completed during my time at GA. The goal of the project was to take a 
                game, and using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, turn it into a computer app. This project incorporates event-driven 
                programming, through use of DOM elements. I chose to do the game Battleship. 
                I knew going into this project that there would be challenges of incorporating computer AI if I 
                wanted the game to actually be fun. I enjoyed this challenge, along with figuring out how to get the user to
                place their ships, requiring each cell choice to be adjacent and in the same vertical/horizontal choice direction.
                If I had more time to work on this project, I would like to refactor a lot of my functions because they are quite large, 
                and implement more smaller functions.

            This project is a Node/Express/MongoDB app similar to Yelp. It allows users to sign in using Google OAuth authentication, and 
            search restaurants in their city using the Zomato third party API. Once a restauranted is selected and added, they can 
            leave a review for their peers to view. Users can also check out other people's restaurants and reviews. This application implements
            full CRUD functionality.  My favorite part of working on this app was incorporating the third party API, Zomato. I love data, and I think 
            it was really interesting seeing how others design their database and why they chose to do it the way they did.A future goal I would like to 
            implement in this application is to turn it into a dating app. I think there is something about food that brings people together, and people
            who eat together stay together!

            <p class="edescr">This project was our final project in our GA software engineering immersive course, and the goal was to create a full 
                stack app using the MERN stack: : MongoDB/Mongoose, Express, React, NodeJS. Token based authentication, and authorization
                is also used. The app I chose to create is a cheese and wine tracker. It comes with a cheese and wine pairing guide for reference, 
                to help users get some idea of what they should be eating with the type of wine they choose. 
                The user can search wines from Global Wines database, and select a wine to add to their 'wine diary'.
                In their diary, they can add cheeses that they paired with the wine, and add additional notes so they 
                can remember for next time. One challenge I had while making this app was finding a wine API that had the 
                type of wine (merlot, cabernet..). However, I was unable to find one for free. I wanted to be able to offer a 
                cheese recommendation based on the type of wine, so a future goal is to have the user select what type of wine it is, and work 
                with that. My favorite part of this app along with others I have worked with is working with the third party
                API. I really enjoy seeing how others choose to store their data adn design their models.</p>
